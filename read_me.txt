The purpose of this project is to chart average temps per decade from 1950 to 2019. I was interested if we would be able to see the effects of global warming, in such a small span of time relative to the Earth's age. I was pretty surprised throughout the project how seemingly close the data was until it was graphed. The last decade just looked like an outlier as it was warmer all the way around. 
To run the project you should install the following packages to python:
pandas
matplotlib
numpy
