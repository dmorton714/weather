<h1> <b>Project scope </b></h1>

I started with the question, can you see a global warming trend from the 1950's to now?
I downloaded the daily average, high, and low temps from https://www.noaa.gov/. 
<li>Then I started brainstorming how I wanted to use the data. </li>
<li> It was determined that averaging the decades per month would be a great way to see the data without being overwhelming.</li>
<li> I was surprised that you are able to see a bit of a warming trend. Even though it is a small rise, it is a rise. </li> 
<li> I also graphed the hottest and coldest months to see what it looks like over the decades. It seems pretty consistent.</li>

<h1><b>Data project requirements:</b></h1>

1. read data in 
I made lists and dictionaries from the csv files I loaded in. So I satisfied the first 2 options. 

2. Manipulate or clean your data. 
I removed NaNs from the data set. 

3. Analyze your data 
I used 5 functions to do various things with the data. I got the shape of the data determining the headers and row length. I also did several min max and averages in different ways.

4. Visualize your data 
I made to graphs. One with 7 plots comparing the data by decade. Then another one with 2 plots looking at the hottest and coldest months by decade. 

5. Interpreting my data
I did markdown frames making notes of what was happening with the data and the code. 

6. GitHub 
I have made a ton of commits 16+

7. submit project
