<h1>Global Warming in Louisville KY <h2>

<h1> <b>Project scope </b></h1>

I started with the question, can you see a global warming trend from the 1950's to now?
I downloaded the daily average, high, and low temps from https://www.noaa.gov/ for louisville KY. 

<li>Then I started brainstorming how I wanted to use the data. </li>
<li> It was determined that averaging the decades per month would be a great way to see the data without being overwhelming.</li>
<li> I was surprised that you are able to see a bit of a warming trend. Even though it is a small rise, it is a rise. </li> 
<li> I also graphed the hottest and coldest months to see what it looks like over the decades. It seems pretty consistent.</li>
